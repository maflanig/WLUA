            <h2 id="kirlin">Madelaine B. Kirlin Award</h2>
               <p>Presented annually to the umpire and junior umpire who best demonstrate the qualities of dedication, hard
                  work and service that Madelaine exemplified during her life. Madelaine was a long-time high school and
                  college umpire with WLUA that went above and beyond her umpire responsibilities. She served as a mentor,
                  leader and dear friend to all. She was the kind of partner all wanted to work with. Her passion for
                  lacrosse and giving to our lacrosse community surpassed her responsibility of being on the field.</p>
